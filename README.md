# Memoir
Where Plex can be your DIY Netflix, Memoir aspires to be your DIY Google Photos. It is a self-hosted solution to keep memoirs (images, video's ...) backed up in your personal digital space, but also including easy exploration.

Memoir consists of a database hosted on your personal server. This database keeps media-items (images, video's, audio files...) and their metadata. The database is accessible and mutable on clients in your browser and a mobile application.

## Feature brainstorm
- people tagging
- photo albums
- personal instagram page (i.e. album type)
- search on image content
- recipe box -> pictures of recipes, images of food, recipe text
- locations on a map
- automatic content creation: aftermovies, GIFs
- moodboards (like pinterest) (i.e. album type)
